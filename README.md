The goal is to create a model able to answer high school discussion questions.

So far so good.

## How to use
1. Create `config.py` in the root folder. 
2. The only line you need in there is `api_key = "[KEY]"`. 
3. Replace `[KEY]` with your OpenAi API key.
4. Enter `streamlit run ./streamlit_main.py` into your console.
